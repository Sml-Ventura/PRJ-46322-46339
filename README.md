### Abstract:
(From the written report) <br>
"This module is part of the Sea2Future project from Escola Náutica Infante D. Henrique, and was developed to be used in conjunction with the autonomous craft developed by them that produces a set of data that needs to be processed and stored locally and temporarily. <br>
This work arises due to the problem of storing the data that is recorded by the vessel in an environment where there is limited storage. Additionally a local and online storage solution should also be contemplated, with appropriate data transmission where possible to allow for limited space management."<br>
